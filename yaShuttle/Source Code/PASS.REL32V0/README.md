This folder contains a modified form of release 32V0 of the original (Shuttle era) HAL/S compiler (HAL/S-FC).  The modifications are intended not to affect functionality in any way, but instead to address certain changes to the commonly-available computing environments which have occurred over the course of decades.  The issues addressed are these:

* The files, originally encoded in EBCDIC, are here encoded almost entirely in 7-bit ASCII.  *Note:* Most of this conversion occurred before I ever received this source code.  I cannot speak to when, why, or by whom it was done.  I *presume* that the conversion was performed for the sake of readability on modern platforms rather than because the compiler in use suddenly began accepting ASCII(ish) code.  Of course, my presumption may be wrong, but the point is that there is no reason to believe that this ASCII form of the code ever had been correctly compiled or even that it *could* have been compiled by the Shuttle-era development software.
* As presented to me in the form of ASCII files, there are nevertheless occasional appearances of uninterpretable characters: i.e., of characters not actually having a 7-bit ASCII representation.  These characters were instead encoded idiosyncratically rather than using any univerally-accepted encoding, and therefore I've had to additionally convert them, in this case to UTF-8.  The offending characters are "¬" (logical-NOT) and "&cent;" (U.S. cent), as well as the unprintable `NUL` (numerically, 00) character, which was simply deleted whenever I found it.  Some of the ASCII files I received already used the undocumented replacement of "&tilde;" or "^" for "¬", but I have left those as-is.  It is perhaps worth noting that the modern HAL/S compiler transparently accepts either "&tilde;" or "^" as a replacement for "¬", and "`" in place of "&cent;"; if I had used that fact, I could have presented all source code here as 7-bit ASCII, without resorting to UTF-8 at all, but I have not done so.
* As presented to me, none of the source-code files have extensions to their filenames that can be used to determine the programming languages used.  While I'm no great fan of filename extensions, I feel that they serve a useful purpose in documenting computer source code, and they enable presentation software (including GitHub's) to apply appropriate syntax highlighting (if defined).  I have therefore modified XPL and BAL files to have the filename extensions ".xpl" and ".bal" respectively.  There are no HAL/S files in this folder, but if there were, they would have received the filename extension ".hal".
* Finally, headers in the form of comment blocks have been added to the tops of each XPL or BAL source file.  These are in the form of legal XPL or BAL comments, and thus do not affect the compiled or assembled forms *functionally*, though they would have the effect of altering line-numbering in listings or error messages produced by compilers or assemblers.  These "modern comments" are usually distinguishable from the contemporary comments in that they obey the following convention:
    * "/*/" is used as the opening of an inline comment in XPL.  Contemporary comments wouldn't usually have the trailing "/".
    * "*/" is used as the prefix for a comment in BAL.  Contemporary comments wouldn't usually have the trailing "/".

The final two conversion steps are performed by the script header.py (and helper files header.xpl and header.bal) found higher in this source tree.  Detection of illegal characters is also performed by the script, though its only effect on finding them is to abort with error messages rather than actually attempting a repair.  Fortunately, there are very, very few files containing the illegal characters.

Other than the XPL and BAL source-code file mentioned above, there are JCL and CLIST files, and possibly other non-source-code types I don't recognize.  I have made no attempt whatever to alter any of their filenames or to append comments to them.

Finally, it perhaps goes without saying, but all of these alterations mean that even if the original XPL compiler and BAL assembler were available, along with the original operating environment that accepted JCL and CLIST files, they could not actually compile the HAL/S-FC code as it is presented here.  If in the future it does become possible to acquire and run the original XPL compiler and BAL assembler, hopefully conversion back to the required EBCDIC form, restoration of the original filenames, and removal of "modern comments" would be straightforward and could be completely automated.
