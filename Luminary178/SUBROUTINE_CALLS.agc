## Purpose:     A section of Luminary revision 178.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the final
##              release of the flight software for the Lunar Module's
##              (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 14. The
##              code has been recreated from copies of Zerlina 56, Luminary
##              210, and Luminary 131, as well as many Luminary memos.
##              It has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Luminary 178 in NASA
##              drawing 2021152N, which gives relatively high confidence
##              that the reconstruction is correct.

## Mod history: 2019-08-14 MAS  Created from Zerlina 56.
##              2019-09-17 MAS  Changed subroutine names to match those
##                              of Luminary proper.

## Luminary 178, as a release version, likely had explicit version numbers for
## all of the subroutines hardcoded. Since this has been reconstructed from
## multiple distant versions, the exact version numbers of each subroutine are
## unknown, and so they have been left blank.
